# ElaraExample

Example program for Elara.

This repo provides a library that implements a self-resizing array. But the interesting part is that it provides an example of how to use Elara in your own projects.

Elara is a BDD testing framework written in C, similar to [rspec](http://rspec.info), [quick](https://github.com/quick/quick), or [cedar](https://github.com/pivotal/cedar). It allows you to write simple, intuitive tests that follow the forks of the program.
